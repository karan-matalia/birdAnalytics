This is a repository that uses ebird csv files to generate a gif and images to track migration.
This has currently 2 modes for generating gifs

  1. Common Months- where all months within the csv will be combined to form a gif 
  2. Separate Months- where each months will be a separate frame in the csv
 
 The shapefiles included in this project have not been created by me and are not entirely accurate.
